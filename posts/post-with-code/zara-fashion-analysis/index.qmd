## 🧭 Project Background

### Why Fashion?
- Our group members are interested in fashion and marketing.
- Fashion plays an important role in consumers' daily decision-making.

### Why ZARA?
- ZARA is a well-known brand in Korea.
- It has strong global presence and fast fashion structure.

### Research Question
What is the relationship between consumer characteristics and the number of clothing sales?


## 📂 Dataset Overview

- Data Source: Kaggle (`Fashion World DA`)
- Brand: ZARA
- Time period: 2018–2022

### Included Variables
- Numerical: `price`, `reviews_count`, `wish_list_count`, ...
- Categorical: `gender`, `category`, `pattern`, `season`, `material`, ...

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project explores ZARA fashion data (2018–2022), analyzing the relationship between price, category, gender, and sales.

We used:
- ggplot2 for visualizations
- infer package for permutation hypothesis testing

## 📊 Visualizations

### 💸 Price vs Sales Count

```{r}
# Scatter plot
ggplot(fashion, aes(x = price, y = sales_count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Price vs. Sales Count", x = "Price", y = "Sales Count")

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Sales by Gender
fashion %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = total_sales, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Sales by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Sales Count")

---

## Hypothesis Testing
We tested whether there is a significant difference in sales by gender using permutation tests.

library(infer)

null_dist <- fashion %>%
  specify(sales_count ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Male", "Female"))

obs_stat <- fashion %>%
  specify(sales_count ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Male", "Female"))

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, direction = "two_sided")
