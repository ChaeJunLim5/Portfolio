## 🧾 Project Overview

This project explores ZARA fashion data (2018–2022), analyzing the relationship between price, category, gender, and sales.

We used:
- ggplot2 for visualizations
- infer package for permutation hypothesis testing

## 📊 Visualizations

### 💸 Price vs Sales Count

- Scatter plot shows weak negative correlation between price and sales.
- High sales tend to occur at lower price points.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Sales by Gender

- Males tend to purchase more items than females in dataset.
- Gender difference confirmed through permutation test.

## 🔬 Hypothesis Testing Summary

We conducted a permutation test using the `infer` package to check if gender has a statistically significant effect on sales count.

- **Null hypothesis**: Sales count is independent of gender.
- **p-value**: 0.02 (suggests statistical significance at 5% level)
- **Conclusion**: Gender **does** influence purchasing behavior in ZARA data.
